      <P><B>Maneuvering and Warning Signals</B></P>
         <DL>
            <DT>a) When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile
            of each other, each vessel underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by these Rules:
               <DL>
                  <DT>1) shall indicate that maneuver by the following signals on her whistle:
                     <DL>
                        <DT>one short blast to mean "I intend to leave you on my port side"
                        <DT>two short blasts to mean "I intend to leave you on my starboard side"
                        <DT>three short blasts to mean "I am operating astern propulsion"
                     </DL>
                  <DT>2) upon hearing the one or two blast signal of the other shall, if in agreement, sound the same whistle
                  signal and take the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, from any cause, the vessel doubts
                  the safety of the proposed maneuver, she shall sound the danger signal specified in paragraph (d) of this Rule
                  and each vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing agreement is made
               </DL>
            <DT>b) A vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule by light signals:
               <DL>
                  <DT>1) These signals shall have the following significance:
                     <DL>
                        <DT>one flash to mean "I intend to leave you on my port side"
                        <DT>two flashes to mean "I intend to leave you on my starboard side"
                        <DT>three flashes to mean "I am operating astern propulsion"
                     </DL>
                  <DT>2) The duration of each flash shall be about 1 second
                  <DT>3) The light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or yellow light, visible at a
                  minimum range of 2 miles, synchronized with the whistle, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I of the
                  referenced instruction
               </DL>
            <DT>c) When in sight of one another:
               <DL>
                  <DT>1) a power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by the
                  following signals on her whistle:
                     <DL>
                        <DT>one short blast to mean "I intend to overtake you on your starboard side"
                        <DT>two short blasts to mean "I intend to overtake you on your port side"
                     </DL>
                  <DT>2) the power-driven vessel about to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound a similar sound signal. If in
                  doubt she shall sound the danger signal prescribed in paragraph (d)
               </DL>
            <DT>d) When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand
            the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid
            collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the
            whistle. This signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.
            <DT>e) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening
            obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. This signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel
            that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.
            <DT>f) If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, one whistle only shall be used for
            giving maneuvering and warning signals.
            <DT>g) When a power-driven vessel is leaving a dock or berth, she shall sound one prolonged blast.
            <DT>h) A vessel that reaches agreement with another vessel in a meeting, crossing, or overtaking situation by using the
            radiotelephone as prescribed by the Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (85 Stat. 165; 33 U.S.C. 1207), is not obliged to
            sound the whistle signals prescribed by this Rule, but may do so. If agreement is not reached, then whistle signals shall
            be exchanged in a timely manner and shall prevail.
         </DL>
         
      <P><B>Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility</B></P>
         <P>In or near an area of restricted visibility, whether by day or night, the signals prescribed in this Rule shall be used as
         follows:</P>
         <DL>
            <DT>a) A power-driven vessel making way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes one prolonged
            blast.
            <DT>b) A power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more
            than 2 minutes two prolonged blasts in succession with an interval of about 2 seconds between them.
            <DT>c) A vessel not under command; a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver, whether underway or at anchor; a sailing
            vessel; a vessel engaged in fishing, whether underway or at anchor; and a vessel engaged in towing or pushing another vessel
            shall, instead of the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes,
            three blasts in succession; namely, one prolonged followed by two short blasts.
            <DT>d) A vessel towed or if more than one vessel is towed the last vessel of the tow, if manned, shall at intervals of not more
            than 2 minutes sound four blasts in succession; namely, one prolonged followed by three short blasts. When practicable, this signal
            shall be made immediately after the signal made by the towing vessel.
            <DT>e) When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit they shall be regarded as a
            power-driven vessel and shall give the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule.
            <DT>f) A vessel at anchor shall at intervals of not more than 1 minute ring the bell rapidly for about 5 seconds. In a vessel of
            100 meters or more in length the bell shall be sounded in the forepart of the vessel and immediately after the ringing of the bell
            the gong shall be sounded rapidly for about 5 seconds in the after part of the vessel. A vessel at anchor may in addition sound three
            blasts in succession, namely one short, one prolonged and one shod blast, to give warning of her position and of the possibility of
            collision to an approaching vessel.
            <DT>g) A vessel aground shall give the bell signal and if required the gong signal prescribed in paragraph (g) of this Rule and shall,
            in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. A vessel
            aground may in addition sound an appropriate whistle signal.
            <DT>h) A vessel of less than 12 meters in length shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals but, if she does not, shall
            make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.
            <DT>i) A pilot vessel when engaged on postage duty may in addition to the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) or (g) of this Rule
            sound an identity signal consisting of four short blasts.
            <DT>j) The following vessels shall not be required to sound signals as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this Rule when anchored in a special
            anchorage area designated by the Secretary:
               <DL>
                  <DT>1) a vessel of less than 20 meters in length; and
                  <DT>2) a barge, canal boat, scow, or other nondescript craft<
               /DL>
         </DL>
         
      <P><B>Signals to Attract Attention</B></P>
         <P>If necessary to attract the attention of another vessel, any vessel may make light or sound signals that cannot be mistaken for any signal
         authorized elsewhere in these Rules, or may direct the beam of her search light in the direction of the danger, in such a way as not to embarrass
         any vessel
      </P>
      
      <P><B>Distress Signals</B></P>
         <DL>
            <DT>When a vessel is in distress and requires assistance she shall use or exhibit the following signals:
               <DL>

         </DL>
         
      <P><B>Aids to Navigation</B></P>
         <P>When operating a vessel always have a navigational chart to identify any aids to navigation.  Military personnel may sign one out at the
         Office of the Harbor Master.  Listed on the legend will be an index of what aids are used in that geographic area.  Some examples of some
         aids to navigation are as follows:</P>
            <DL>
               <DT>Lighthouses
               <DT>Port and Starboard channel markers (buoy's)

      <P>This completes the information on Rules of the Road.<BR><BR>
      Note: This course only teaches the Inland rules of navigation, International rules can be taught in another course.  Most International rules
      are similar to the Inland Rules, with some slight changes.</P>
